## What I did extra?
- Along with my journey of learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning Concepts in deep, understanding various real life applications and when to use which tech, I learnt how to develop a Python application using Python framework called *streamlit*
- Streamlit is an opensource Machine Learning and Data Science framework which helps one to make interactive web apps faster.
- I made a Streamlit app for my main and final project - Movie Recommendation System.
- User can input their favourite movies, give it some rating as per their liking betweena range of 1-5 and my model will list some of the best movies as per user's taste.
